# HQ Trivia Web App

The web application for HQ Trivia.

Born from a desire for my wife and I to entertain our families over the holidays, we started to build custom Trivia games.
However, our guests quickly wanted to become hosts of the game, and had some gripes about who buzzed in and when.
HQ Trivia is a solve for it all!  Giving anyone the ability to host a trivia game with custom question, and a time stamped buzzer to individuals or teams.

The web application is a portal for game hosts to create their trivia games, invite guests to play their game and monitor player interactions during game play.

The web app also allows for players who don't want to download a native app (coming soon) to have the buzzer in a mobile web app version.
